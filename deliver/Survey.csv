I work in computational quantum physics, and in my ""old"" workflows, e.g., with Fortran codes, the computation and analysis were usually well-separated: The results from (potentially long-running) simulations were saved as text files, and then analyzed/plotted with, e.g., gnuplot.  Jupyter Notebook makes this more convenient by allowing me combine simulation and analysis in a single notebook without the intermediate step of saving text files and reading the data again. However, this also makes it much easier to ""lose"" results that only ever existed as data, but were not written to files. Going back to writing text files for all of the possibly interesting output would be a step back regarding the interactivity, so an easy way to save program state or something similar would be great. I realize this is not directly within the scope of the Jupyter Notebook, as it corresponds to a general persistence solution for Python, but it's definitely a pain point that is made more relevant by the dynamic nature of the Notebook.","One year or more","","","","As a standalone application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, at this point, the upstart for them is still tough. These students have no programming experience, and we are leveraging the notebook as a rapid way to build interactive simulations.

Jupyter Notebooks are great for teaching, but I find that being browser-based is a huge hindrance for data exploration and exploratory programming.  In a nutshell, any web-based interface feels much slower than a similar console-based interface, and I personally think they slow down experimentation.  For that reason, I tend to use an IPython console extensively for day-to-day work and only use a Jupyter Notebook when I'm developing tutorials or similar documents.  Keep in mind that this is purely a personal preference.  Notebooks are a great communication tool, and Jupyter is an absolutely fabulous implementation, but they aren't a good fit for rapid experimentation, in my opinion.","One year or more","","","","As a standalone application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The namespace gets polluted from previously run cells even if those cells were later changed, resulting in hard-to-find bugs where I change a function name where it is defined in cell 1 but forget to change it where it is called in cell 2 and there is no apparent error, because cell 2 is silently calling the old function. I have taken to restarting the entire notebook and running every cell over again when I want to make a major change to a function, which is pretty slow. 2. When I am using parallel engines and something goes wrong I typically have to restart the engines and restart the notebook I'm working on, including running all the cells again (some kind of caching would help make this faster, like in R Notebooks).

When reading code in another IDE, I know the execution order is determined by the visual order in combination with the call graph. In Jupyter Notebook, since a cell below could've been executed before a cell above, the ordering now must include the numbers next to the cells; this is too many elements for me to keep track of.

Static typing, slow and proper software design, planned unit testing, data provenance, logging, etc., etc., are all extremely important **even in a rapid prototyping situation**. In fact, these things might be even more important for a rapid prototype than for more traditional software development. The notebook is just not a good setting for these things, even though many of the types of problems the notebook is supposed to help solve (interactive data cleaning, rapid prototyping, cursory data exploration) should all be heavily, heavily based on proper design, unit testing, and so on, even when they are being worked on in a ""rapid"" environment.","One year or more","Flask","SQLAlchemy","git / github","As a standalone application","","Standardizing an environment within which to display demoware","Creating interactive user guides and tutorials","","Unit testing as a first class (and potentially mandatory) concept, to avoid messy linear scripts, pure growth by attrition, etc.","Modular design through real functions, not throwaway quick and dirty functions","data provenance -- automatically logging data load operations followed by any mutations, transformations, or derivations of data within a notebook.

Since so many people misuse the tool this way, I think it's fair to say it's the tool's fault for not enforcing some mechanism that makes bad coding practices more painful.","","Interactive unit testing -- linking a function to other defined properties (in a Haskell QuickCheck sort of way) or other functions that will be called if the notebook is run in ""test"" mode, also allowing certain code cells to be specified as set up and tear down like you would for an actual unittest.TestCase object. Allowing a notebook mode in which this is actually mandatory would be even better.","Data provenance mode -- enable a mode where any time an object is created, it is traced over its lifetime and any data which is derived from it (like, say 'z = y + 1' is derived from 'y') will be logged. This way, any data cleaning, outlier manipulation, etc., needed for reproducibility will be logged and tracked. No one can just load up some data from a .csv file, manipulate it in pandas, and dump it back into the .csv file, without there being a log of those data operations.","","Make it easier to customize the styles, change the way cells show up and/or reveal for a presentation, allow users to monkey around more easily with the backend kernel and more easily write kernels for new languages without needing to know much ZMQ for themselves.","","","convenient;accessible;quick;flexible","","Financial modeling","2-5 years","Finance","Technology Consulting","Education Technology","Tens"

I run the notebook server on code in a Git master branch and I sync that with a local branch periodically. I have mostly just used Idle in the past because that is very flexible and I get a complete transcript of my programming session. But support for Idle and improvements to Idle have mostly stopped. I like the general idea of the notebook but the format doesn't support some things very well - testing for example. I would like to have my tests in a separate notebook that is linked to the one I'm currently developing (same kernel I guess). I would like my tests to be separate because if they are in the same notebook as my normal code then it is distracting. I could migrate out my tests to  a separate file, but then they are not in the same notebook format as the regular code which is very convenient.  Some things in Jupyter are frustrating: 1. the kernel cannot be reliably interrupted. 2. kernel crashes. This means that datasets must be reloaded which can take a long time in my case. 3. code is not reloaded easily: I have to manually use reload(module) if the code is in a file. The notebook should reliably reload modules: I realize that this is a long-standing problem in Python generally that has still not been resolved after all these years. 4. code reload in a cell is very buggy. I've had old code remain in a cell after making a change that has caused some strange results. A reload of the code in a cell should clean out all of the old definitions and variables in that cell so that there can't be any strange behaviour due to old references.

I call this a Mac UI problem, because this is something Windows do right and Mac do ""wrong"".   My goal is to be able to navigate a long document primary using keyboard and minimize the need of mouse. This involve pressing the arrow keys for scrolling in small step, and the page up and down button for large step. In a edit view in Mac, arrow key control the cursor and page key control the view port and they are not connect to each other. So if I page down to a new location and trying to make fine adjustment using the arrow key, not noticing the cursor remain in the same location despite I have pressed the page down key, the view sprung right back to the original cursor location, dropping my effort with the page key. In Windows, page up and page down will pull the cursor along so that the two set of key can work together for moving in small or big step.  Again the goal is to be able to quick navigate the document using keyboard, primary using the arrow and page keys.","\{latex symbol} {tab} to enter math symbol like Julia notebook.","For a really long notebook, the ability to collapse parts into an outline","A video tutorial perhaps.

You basically need to modify the code that you used to create a plot and rerun its cell in order to modify the plot. Embedded plots are not interactive and regular matplotlib figures are not that dynamic to begin with. You can zoom and pan but you cannot modify them in any other way (e.g. you cannot select a plot element and modify its color, delete it or add a fitting curve as in Matlab). Some of these are limitations of matplotlib of course but that is part of the whole ""Jupyter package"".  Creating interactive plots and widgets is too complicated at the moment. It requires too much programming.  It is hard to generate a nice report that you can share with non technical people from a Jupyter notebook because there is no way (AFAIK) to hide the code cells from the output. It would be cool to be able to mark a cell as ""hidden code"" which would be excluded from the generated PDF for example.  The UI is a bit clunky and editing code is a bit painful when there is a lot of code in a cell.  Being able to run cells out of order is cool but it also makes it hard to reproduce what you did later. This makes it particularly hard to turn a notebook into a proper Python script sometimes. It would be great if you could somehow replay the notebook in the order that you executed it and export that in the proper order. Maybe there should be a way to programmatically execute a cell from another cell (maybe this is already possible and Injust don't know about it).","One year or more","Mercurial","Pandoc","Interactive graphing tools","As a standalone application","","Interactive data analysis","Remote data access","Program / script prototyping","Interactive plot exploration (which is much better in Matlab)","Full program development","","Easy to add inline plots","Being able to access notebooks remotely","Interactive execution environment","Hard to add interactive plots (requires way too much programming)","Cannot hide certain code cells from final PDF output","Hard to reproduce cell execution order","Easy to use interactive plots and widgets (particularly matplotlib-like plots)","Hidden code blocks","A way to tell when cell output is not up to date (i.e. it depends on data that has changed)","Easier way to reorder cells (interactively and according to how I executed them)","Better code editing in cells","Interactive plots","convenient;cool","","Engineer","5+ years","Digital communications","Test and measurement","","Under ten"

My main grievances were the lack of more advanced (code-) editor features like incremental searching and an outline view for better navigation (during presentation and writing). I am aware of plugins, which I unfortunately could not to get work seamlessly (in Anaconda).   One thing which lets me prefer Spyder for my daily work is its context sensitive help, where or each command you type in a separate window a nicely typeset help text appears automatically. When using Scipy extensively, this is a real help.   For casual users like me, the number of key strokes and commands one needs to remember for efficient work is a burden. Extended tool bars (especially for Markdown) could flatten the learning curve quite a bit.   Furthermore, typesetting advanced math is a bit cumbersome (especially when looking for typos which prevent rendering, integrating your own macros, equation cross referencing, etc).

So currently software development in a notebook to external module is a 1-way street, and not a particularly easy one to navigate.   Also, inconsistency in relative import statements make developing software packages in a notebook/module. Given the portable nature of the notebook, it's nice to be able to work from the same source files on a variety of computers. But absolute paths can't be used across machines (unless they follow the same convention) and its not clear how one would specify the absolute path relative to the location of the notebook server and vs. notebook itself.  Editing documentation in the notebook (especially with executable examples) would make it easier to jump between source code and explicit documentation. Linking a particular cell out to a particular docstring for a particular function/class/method would be great.","One year or more","Software Development","Executable Documentation","More extensive Math and manuscript formatting (e.g., XeLaTeX/LaTeX  support for external packages, style files, and non-web based bibliographies; e.g., for publication with ieee, nips, scipy)","As a standalone application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
