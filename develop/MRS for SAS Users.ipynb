    "# MRS for SAS Users\n",
    "\n",
    "**R** is a very popular programming language with a rich set of features and packages that make it ideally suited for data analysis and modeling.\n",
    "Traditionally, R works by loading, i.e copying, everything (including data sets) as objects in the memory.  This means that large data sets can quickly surpass the amount of memory needed to load them into an R session. Over time, many R packages have been introduced that attempt to overcome this limitation.  Some packages propose a way to more efficiently load and process the data, which would in turn allow us to work with larger data sizes.  This approach however can only take us so far, since efficiency eventually hits a wall.  Microsoft R Server (MRS) on the other hand takes a different approach.  MRS's **RevoScaleR** package stores the dataset on the disk (hard drive) and loads it only a **chunks** at a time (where each chunk is a certain number of rows) for processsing.  When the processing is done, it then moves to the next chunk of the data. By default, the **chunk size** is set to 500K rows, but we can change it to a lower number when dealing with *wider* datasets (lots of columns), and a larger number when dealing with *longer* data sets (few columns).  In other words, data in RevoScaleR is *external* (because it's stored on disk) and *distributed* (because we process it chunk-wise). This means we are no longer bound by memory when dealing with data: Our data can be as large as we have hard-disk capacity to store it with, since at every point in time, we only load one chunk of the data as a memory object (an R **list** object to be specific), we never overexert the system's memory.  However, since there is no such thing as a free lunch, there is a cost to pay when working with distributed data: Since most open-source R algorithms for data processing and analysis (including most third-party packages) rely on the whole dataset to be loaded into the R session as a `data.frame` object, they no longer work *directly* with distributed data.  However, as we will see,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most data-processing steps (cleaning data, creating new columns or modifying existing ones) can still *indirectly* (and relatively easily) be used by RevoScaleR to process the distributed data, so that we can still leverage any R code we developed.  What we mean by *indirectly* will become clear as we cover a wide range of examples.\n",
    "- On the other hand, some data processing steps (such as merging data or sorting data) and most analytics algorithms (such as the `lm` function used to build linear models) have their RevoScaleR counterparts which  mirror those functionalities but also work on distributed data sets.  For example, RevoScaleR has an `rxLinMod` function which is replicates what `lm` does, but because `rxLinMod` is a distributed algorithm it runs both on a `data.frame` (where it far outperforms `lm` if the `data.frame` in question is large), and on a distributed dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, using `RevoScaleR` we can both leverage existing R functionality (such as what's offered by R's rich set of third-party packages) and use what `RevoScaleR` offers through it's own set of distributed functions.  One last advantage that `RevoScaleR`'s distributed functions offer is code portability:\n",
    "Because open-source R's analytics functions are generally not parallel, using these algorithms in an inherently distributed environment like Hadoop means having to rewrite our R functions code in mappers and reducers that Hadoop understands, which can be a daunting task as we mentioned earlier.  The inherently parellel data processing and analysis functions in `RevoScaleR` on the other hand make them ideal for porting our code from MRS running on a single machine to MRS on a Hadoop cluster or other inherently distributed environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The NYC Taxi data\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how we can use MRS to process and analyze a large dataset, we use the NYC Taxi dataset.  The raw dataset spans over multiple years and for each year it consists of a set of 12 CSV files.  Each record (row) in the file shows a Taxi trip in New York City, with the following important attributes (columns) recorded: the date and time the passenger(s) was picked up and dropped off, the number of passengers per trip, the distance covered, the latitude and longitude at which passengers were picked up and dropped off, and finally payment information such as the type of payment and the cost of the trip broken up by the fare amount, the amount passengers tipped, and any other surcharges.\n",

    "Our first task is to read the data using MRS. MRS has two ways of dealing with flat files: (1) it can work directly with the flat files, meaning that it reads and writes to flat files directly, (2) it can covert flat files to a format called XDF (XDF stands for external data frame).  An XDF file is much smaller than a CSV file because it is compressed.  Its main advantage over a CSV file is that an XDF file can be read and processed much faster than a CSV file (we will run some benchmarks to see how much faster).  The disadvantage of an XDF file format is a format that only MRS understands and can work with.  So in order to decide whether we chose XDF or CSV we need to understand the tradeoffs involved:\n",

    "Since an anlytics workflow usually consists of cleaning and munging data, and then feeding that to various modeling and data-mining algorithms, the initial runtime of converting from CSV to XDF is quickly offset by the reduced runtime of working with the XDF file.

    "### Cleaning the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is messy and often needs to be cleaned before we can do much with it.  Looking at the above summaries and snapshots of the data, we can often tell how the data needs to be cleaned.  Here are some suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Have missing values been properly accounted for?* In flat files missing values have often a different representation as NAs. For example, missing values for character columns can have an empty entry or one with a catchall term such as 'other' or 'n/a', while missing numeric columns can have empty cells, or use NULL or 999. Sometimes, different codes are used to delineate different kinds of missing values (such as data missing because the information is not relevant, or missing because the information was not provided).  When recoding missing values to NAs in R, it's important to account for such differences.\n",
    "- *Do column types match our expectation?* This is an important consideration, and we dealt with it by explicitly providing column types prior to reading the data.  This is the preferred approach since it avoids unnecessary processing, especially the processing that takes place when R reads in a column as a `factor` when it's not needed.  Columns with high cardinality that are formatted as `factor` add a lot of overhead to R session.  Such columns often don't need to be `factor` and should remain as `integer` or `character` columns.  If we don't know ahead of time which columns should be factors and which not, or if we need to clean a column before turning it into a `factor`, then we can suppress the automatic conversion of `character` columns to `factor` columns by setting `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when we run `rxImport` or specifying all non-numeric columns to be `character` columns.\n",
    "- *Are there outliers in the data and do they seem legitimate?* Often, the question of what an outlier is depends on our understanding of the data and tolerance for deviations from the average patterns in the data.  In the NYC Taxi dataset, consider the following cases: (1) A passenger might take a cab and use it all day for running multiple errands, asking the driver to wait for him.  (2) A passenger might intend to tip 5 dollars and accidentally press 5 twice and tip 55 dollars for a trip that cost 40 dollars.  (3) A passenger could get into a argument with a driver and leave without paying.  (4) Multi-passenger trips could have one person pay for everyone or each person pay for himself, with some paying with a card and others using cash. (5) A driver can accidentally keep the meter running after dropping someone off.  (6) Machine logging errors can result in either no data or wrong data points.  In all of these cases, even assuming that we can easily capture the behavior (because some combination of data points falls within unusual ranges) whether or not we consider them *legitimate* still depends on what the purpose of our analysis is.  An outlier could be noise to one analysis and a point of interest to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the data with candidate outliers, we can examine it for certain patterns.  For example, we can plot a histogram of `trip_distance` and notice that almost all trips traveled a distance of less than 20 miles, with the great majority going less than 5 miles.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's see how we could use `RevoScaleR` to examine the data for outliers.  Our approach here is rather premitive, but the intent is to show how the use the tools:  We use `rxDataStep` and its `rowSelection` argument to extract all the data points that are candidate outliers.  By leaving the `outFile` argument we output the resulting dataset into a `data.frame` which we call `odd_trips`.  Lastly, if we are too expansive in our outlier selection criteria, then resulting `data.frame` could still have too many rows (which could clog the memory and make it slow to produce plots and other summaries).  So we create a new column `u` and populate it with random uniform numbers between 0 and 1, and we add `u < .05` to our `rowSelection` criteria.  We can adjust this number to end up with a smaller `data.frame` (threshold closer to 0) or a larger `data.frame` (threshold closer to 1).\n",

We will use the pick-up and drop-off neighborhoods and the time and day of the trip as the variables most likely to influence tip. Let's begin by building a linear model involving two interactive terms: one between `pickup_nb` and `dropoff_nb` and another one between `pickup_dow` and `pickup_hour`. The idea here is that we think trip percent is not just influenced by which neighborhood the passengers was pickup up from, or which neighborhood they were dropped off to, but which neighborhood they were picked up from AND dropped off to. Similarly, we intuit that the day of the week and the hour of the day together infulence tipping. For example, just becuase people tip high on Sundays between 9 and 12, doesn't mean that they tend to tip high any day of the week between 9 and 12PM, or any time of the day on a Sunday. This intuition is encoded in the model formula argument that we pass to the `rxLinMod` function: `tip_percent ~ pickup_nb:dropoff_nb + pickup_dow:pickup_hour` where we use `:` to separate interactive terms and `+` to separate additive terms.\n",

    "All models did surprisingly well. This could be an indication that we still have a lot of left-over signal to capture, i.e. the model is **underfitting**. This makes sense, given that there are still a lot of important columns in the data that we left out of the models, such as `payment_type` which has a strong influence on `tip_percent`. We can use RMSE (the square root of the numbers under the `Mean` column above) to compare the models with each other, we don't know how well they do predicting in the first place. So let's also look at the correlation between `tip_percent` and each of the models' predictions.\n",

    "The correlation numbers are somewhat disappointing: as we can see the predictions from our model are not as well as expected. There can be different reasons our predictions are not very accurate, some apply across the board (such as having data that hasn't been properly cleaned, or leaving out important variables), and others are model-specific (for example, linear models can be sensetive to outliers while tree-based models are not). We examine such assumptions more thoroughly in our modeling course, as well as ways that we can improve our models, in another course.\n",
